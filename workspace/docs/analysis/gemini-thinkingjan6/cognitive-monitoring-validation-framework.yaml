title: Connecting Pattern Monitoring to Validation
description: >
  Integration plan for connecting the pattern monitoring framework with the
  validation process, focusing on metric collection and recording.

steps:
  identify_scripts:
    name: Identify Target Validation Scripts
    description: >
      Pinpoint specific validation scripts that need modification, including
      both Python and Mojo validation processes.
    target_scripts:
      - Python validation scripts in validation_scripts directory
      - Mojo validation scripts (e.g., mojo_integrity_validator.mojo)

  locate_recording_points:
    name: Locate Metric Recording Points
    description: >
      Identify key points in validation scripts where metrics can be recorded.
    recording_points:
      - name: Start and End of Validation
        purpose: Record timestamps or start/end events
      - name: File Processing
        purpose: Record number of files being processed
      - name: Integrity Checks
        purpose: Record outcome of integrity checks
      - name: Error Handling
        purpose: Record types and frequency of errors
      - name: Pattern Detection
        purpose: Record pattern occurrences if applicable

  pattern_metrics_integration:
    name: Integrate with PatternMetrics
    description: >
      Determine mechanism for validation scripts to interact with PatternMetrics.
    approaches:
      direct_import:
        name: Direct Import
        description: >
          Import PatternMetrics module directly if in same project
        suitable_for: Tightly coupled architectures
      function_calls:
        name: Function Calls
        description: >
          Define functions in PatternMetrics for validation scripts to call
        suitable_for: Modular architectures
      message_passing:
        name: Message Passing/Event System
        description: >
          Implement event system where validation scripts publish metric data
        suitable_for: Decoupled architectures

  define_metrics:
    name: Define Specific Metrics
    description: Define the specific metrics to be recorded during validation.
    metrics:
      files_validated:

        type: counter
        description: Total count of files processed
      integrity_success_rate:
        name: Integrity Check Success Rate
        type: percentage
        description: >
          Percentage of files passing integrity checks
        calculation: (successful_checks / total_files) * 100
      error_types:
        name: Types of Errors Encountered
        type: map
        description: Breakdown of different error types and frequencies
      validation_time:
        name: Validation Time
        type: duration
        description: Total time taken for validation process
